This is an advanced Excel project. It will bring insight into the performance pattern of each country, sector and product to help decision-makers to maximise their return.

-Removing duplicate

-Identify the highest sales and lowest sales revenue earned 

-Total revenue and profit generated.

-Average revenue

-Total discount allowed

-Total number of sales recorded

-The highest profit generated 

-Finally, the country which generated the highest sales revenue.

##SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

The following skills were demonstrated during the execution of this assignment. The skills demonstrated are listed below:
-Advanced data analysis in Excel

-Data transformation ie using text to column (CSV to Excel)

-Data cleaning ( Removing duplicate)

-Project documentation.


##DATA SOURCING

The data used in this project was provided by the facilitator Promise Chinoso to enable the class to demonstrate their ability to apply their learned Excel skills.

##DATA TRANSFORMATION

The facilitator provided data in comma-delimited CSV, and I had to convert it to usable Excel format. I used the text-to-column function.

##MODELLING

No data modelling was executed due to the fact that the data was recieved in a CSV table.

##ANALYSIS AND VISUALISATION

##CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION.

###Conclusion

The highest performing country and segment were identified as the USA and the government respectively.

###Recommednadtions

I recommend that the organisation must launch an aggressive campaign in order to harness the potential in the US market despite the fact that it has the highest sales volume. The sales revenue per 1000 citizens of that country is very low compared to other markets.
